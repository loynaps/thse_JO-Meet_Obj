1-  //Let's ensure that all GoKarts created have a color. We'll solve this over a few steps.

//First, define a public constructor that expects a String argument named color. (Don't worry about adding any code inside the constructor just yet, we'll do that next.

class GoKart {
  private String color = "red";

  public String getColor() {
    return color;
  }

}


//2-Now in the body of your constructor, set the private field color to the value of the color argument passed into the cons


//3-Finally, since the color is being set in the constructor now, remove the initialization from the field definition...
